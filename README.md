# QuakeMapper — Spatial Earthquake Pattern Analysis

QuakeMapper is a spatial data analysis project exploring earthquake patterns, clustering, and spatio-temporal characteristics across the region of Heraklion (Crete). The project leverages Python for data extraction, transformation, and processing, combined with R for advanced geospatial visualization, to produce interactive map series that illustrate how earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths evolve over time.

This repository accompanies a data-driven analysis focused on answering questions like:

- Do earthquakes cluster spatially or spatio-temporally?
- How do patterns vary by magnitude, depth, or event year?

Technologies used include:

- **Python**: Pandas for data manipulation, GeoPandas and Shapely for geospatial operations, Requests for data fetching, Matplotlib and Contextily for plotting, Regex for text parsing, and Pytest for unit testing.
- **R**: Tmap and other geospatial libraries for map visualization.
- **Data Formats**: TXT files for raw earthquake data, GeoJSON for processed outputs.
