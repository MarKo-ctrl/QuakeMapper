# QuakeMapper — Spatial Earthquake Pattern Analysis
QuakeMapper is a spatial data analysis project exploring earthquake patterns, clustering, and spatio‑temporal characteristics across the region of Heraklion (Crete).
The project combines Python (Pandas, regex, geospatial processing) and R (tmap) to produce map series that visualize how earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths evolve over time.
This repository accompanies a data‑driven analysis focused on answering questions like:

Do earthquakes cluster spatially or spatio‑temporally?
How do patterns vary by magnitude, depth, or event year?

The output is a set of interpretable geospatial figures, enabling both scientific insight and clear communication.
